1.Phase
based on=> "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3sOezpkGWI"
did create 2 folders frontend(client) and backend

2.working with Client or frontend based on react

2.a) for components i am using "shadcn" 
as it have various components codes that can be used
"https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/vite"

b) did as given in documentation of shadcn

c)instead of tsconfig we need to make jsconfig file
with content

{
    "compilerOptions": {
      "baseUrl": ".",
      "paths": {
        "@/*": ["./src/*"]  
      }
    }
}

^ need to be written in jsconfig.json

d)updating the vite.config.js 
we need to not download as given in step 3 of documetation 
just need to update the code that also include
v4 of tailwind css 

e)in our React file
\Chat-App\client>npx shadcn@latest init
we did run this command to make it work

npx shadcn@latest init

and 

the thing that occur during time for refrence

-----------------------

Need to install the following packages:
shadcn@2.4.0-canary.17
Ok to proceed? (y) y

√ Preflight checks.
√ Verifying framework. Found Vite.
√ Validating Tailwind CSS config. Found v4.
√ Validating import alias.
√ Which color would you like to use as the base color? » Slate
√ Writing components.json.
√ Checking registry.
√ Updating src\index.css
  Installing dependencies.

It looks like you are using React 19.
Some packages may fail to install due to peer dependency issues in npm (see https://ui.shadcn.com/react-19).

√ How would you like to proceed? » Use --force
√ Installing dependencies.
√ Created 1 file:
  - src\lib\utils.js

Success! Project initialization completed.
You may now add components.

-----------------------

f) now we need to add components that requires us to download

for example adding button components we can do
npx shadcn@latest add button
The command above will add the Button component to project

to add this button we can do
--------------------
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center min-h-svh">
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App

--------------------

soo we are odne with component set up 

3.
now we will do the dom working of react
for routing

we need to install the dom library react

npm i react-router-dom ==for routing

then in src of client(frontend folder)
we created a folder=pages 
this iwll carry various pages in our App

in folder pages we will create more pages like
a)auth
b)chat
c)profile


a) b) c)
in auth,chat,profile we did created 
1.index.jsx this will look like this

//import react line is removed btw

const Chat = () => {  //Auth and Profile  if in that folder 
  return (
    <div>Chat</div>
  )
}

export default Chat


-------
why use react-router-dom

If we create various components it will cause reloading the pages to move
like anchor tag having a link on hom/about will reload every time

import {
    createBrowserRouter
} from 'react-router-dom'

to immport things we can simply write them in form of array that reduces time and load on our website

App.jsx this is our main 

----
App.jsx
----
import {useState} from 'react
import './App.css'
import React from 'react'
import Navbar from './components/Navbar'
import Home from './components/Home'
import {createBrowserRouter,RouterProvider} from 'react-router-dom'

//^above is what we imported

chech this to understand authentication and profile part
